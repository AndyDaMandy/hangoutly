#Hangoutly

This is a Ruby on Rails application where you and your friends are randomly assigned hangout times! You can set preferences, such as online or in-person, times, etc.

Users can create groups and invite friends. Friends can join groups and these groups will have events assigned to them. I'd like to set up a google calendar API as well to create calendar events.

This will be deployed on Fly.io with postgresql
